      <h1>Brutalism in Architecture</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Brutalism, emerging in the 1950s and gaining prominence in the mid-20th century, is an architectural style known for its bold, stark, and unapologetic designs. Derived from the French term "b√©ton brut", meaning "raw concrete", Brutalism is characterized by its massive monolithic structures, extensive use of exposed concrete, and a distinct lack of external decoration.</p>
      
      <p>The movement was, in part, a response to the post-war urban decline and an answer to the necessity for functional and affordable housing and public buildings. Buildings of this style often dominate their surroundings, projecting strength and functionality above all else.</p>

      <p>While Brutalism was often criticized for its cold and impersonal facades, it was lauded for its honest expression of materials and structural elements. Today, while divisive in opinion, Brutalist architecture remains an integral part of the architectural discourse, representing a pivotal period in architectural history.</p>
