      <p>The contemporary architectural style, often used interchangeably with "modern," is essentially the architecture of the present day. It reflects the ongoing progression of architectural theory and practice, breaking away from traditional forms and embracing unconventional ideas.</p>
      
      <p>Contemporary designs often incorporate open floor plans, large windows, and innovative, sustainable materials. An emphasis on eco-friendly design, sustainable building techniques, and energy efficiency has become a hallmark of this style. The blend of indoor and outdoor spaces is another recurring theme, enhancing connectivity with the environment.</p>

      <p>Overall, contemporary architecture is not just a specific look, but a response to the rapid technological and social changes of the 21st century, emphasizing flexibility, diversity, and innovation.</p>
