      <p>Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) was a Spanish architect celebrated for his groundbreaking designs that combined nature-inspired forms with the decorative characteristics of the Art Nouveau style. Born in Reus, Catalonia, Gaudí became an iconic figure in Catalan Modernism.</p>

      <p>Most of Gaudí's works are located in Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Basilica of the Sagrada Família. Gaudí's designs are marked by their unique style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. He incorporated various materials like ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging, and carpentry into his designs, creating harmonious, organic wholes.</p>

      <p>Throughout his life, Gaudí was deeply religious, which profoundly influenced his architectural philosophy. This spirituality is evident in many of his masterpieces, turning them into more than just buildings but spiritual symbols. His pioneering techniques and distinctive style have left a lasting legacy, making him one of the most famous architects of the 20th century.</p>
