      <p>Zaha Hadid (1950-2016) was a groundbreaking Iraqi-British architect known for her radical deconstructivist designs. She was the first woman to win the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004. With an unmistakable aesthetic, her designs often incorporated sweeping fluid forms and fragmented geometry.</p>
      
      <p>Hadid's structures can be found across the globe, from the Guangzhou Opera House in China to the London Aquatics Centre built for the 2012 Olympics. Despite facing challenges and skepticism in the male-dominated world of architecture, she persistently pushed boundaries and paved the way for future female architects.</p>

      <p>Her practice, Zaha Hadid Architects, continues her legacy, ensuring that her pioneering spirit lives on in her numerous projects and her influence on the architectural world.</p>
