    <main>
      <p>Modernism, a major movement that originated in the late 19th century and early 20th century, sought to break away from traditional forms, embracing minimalism and rejecting ornate stylings. The goal was to reflect the modern age, using new materials and technologies while emphasizing function over form.</p>
      
      <p>The style was characterized by the use of materials like steel, glass, and reinforced concrete. Modernist architects believed in the principle "form follows function," meaning that the purpose of a building should be the primary influence on its design, rather than aesthetic considerations. As a result, many modernist buildings have a streamlined, simple appearance, with an emphasis on vertical and horizontal lines.</p>

      <p>Modernism has left a significant mark on the architectural landscape, with numerous iconic structures worldwide representing the ideals and principles of this influential movement. Its impact is still felt today, as contemporary architects continue to draw inspiration from its innovative approaches and visionary designs.</p>
