      <p>Neoclassicism draws inspiration from the classical art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. Characterized by order, symmetry, and simplicity, the movement was a counterpoint to the elaborate ornamentation of the Baroque and Rococo styles. Public buildings and monuments in the Neoclassical style often exude grandeur and dignity.</p>
