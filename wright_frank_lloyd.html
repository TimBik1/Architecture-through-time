      <p>Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) was an iconic American architect, designer, writer, and educator who introduced a philosophy of architecture called "organic architecture." This concept was about creating structures that harmonized with humanity and the environment. Born in Wisconsin, Wright's innovative designs and structures were ahead of their time, blending seamlessly with the natural world around them.</p>
      
      <p>One of Wright's most famous creations is the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The spiraling form of this museum is a testament to his innovative approach to design and architecture. Wright's style evolved over the years, incorporating different materials, techniques, and aesthetics, but always remained grounded in the belief that buildings should serve to improve the lives of people and integrate harmoniously with the environment.</p>

      <p>Throughout his illustrious career, Wright designed over 1,000 structures and saw more than half of those designs come to fruition. His legacy is celebrated worldwide, with several of his works recognized as UNESCO World Heritage sites.</p>
