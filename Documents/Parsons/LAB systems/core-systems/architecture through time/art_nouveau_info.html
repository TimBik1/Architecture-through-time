      <p>Art Nouveau, which translates to "New Art," emerged in the late 19th century and was prominent until the First World War. It is characterized by its organic, intricate designs and sinuous lines, drawing inspiration predominantly from natural forms and structures.</p>

      <p>The style sought to break away from the historical styles that had dominated architecture and design for the previous 200 years. Instead, Art Nouveau aimed to produce an entirely new style suitable for the modern age. It embraced all forms of art and design and was seen in everything from architecture to decorative arts such as furniture, jewelry, and even textiles.</p>

      <p>Architecturally, Art Nouveau buildings often have asymmetrical shapes, extensive use of arches and curved forms, mosaics, stained glass, and Japanese motifs. The facades might be adorned with floral motifs, ornate curves, and linear designs. The style, though short-lived, left behind a legacy of magnificent buildings and designs across Europe and even influenced other global movements.</p>
