    <main>
      <p>The Baroque style originated in the late 16th century in Italy and is known for its exuberance, drama, and ornamentation. Characterized by its rich details and contrasts, Baroque architecture flourished in churches, palaces, and theatres, presenting a sense of motion and vitality. This style played a crucial role in evoking emotional states, creating grandeur, and reflecting the aspirations of the church and state. Its influence spanned across Europe and impacted architecture, art, and culture profoundly.</p>
