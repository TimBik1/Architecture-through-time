      <p>Ernő Goldfinger (1902-1987) was a prominent Hungarian-born architect and designer, known for his contribution to the Brutalist architectural movement in the United Kingdom. He was often a polarizing figure due to his uncompromising vision and distinct approach to design, but he undeniably played a significant role in shaping the architectural landscape of post-war Britain.</p>
      
      <p>Goldfinger's work often incorporated raw concrete and bold geometric designs. One of his most notable structures is the Trellick Tower in London, a residential high-rise that stands as a quintessential example of Brutalism. While often criticized in its time for its stark aesthetic, Brutalist architecture, as championed by Goldfinger, has gained a dedicated following and appreciation in recent years.</p>

      <p>Throughout his career, Goldfinger emphasized functionality, believing that every element of a design should have a purpose. His buildings, characterized by their robustness and lack of ornamentation, remain influential examples of modern urban design.</p>
